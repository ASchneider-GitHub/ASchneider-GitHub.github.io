# Pre-NYT-Wordle-Clone
A direct clone of the Wordle source code, before the New York Times ruins it with ads. The entire wordlist is stored in the website's JavaScript, so the page will run correctly on it's own for the foreseeable future.

I've stripped out the Google Analytics code, because I don't care about tracking who plays this. I just like word games.
