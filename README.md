# Pre-NYT-Wordle-Clone
A direct clone of the Wordle source code, before the New York Times ruins it with ads. The entire wordlist is stored in the website's JavaScript, so the page will run correctly on it's own for the foreseeable future.

I'll be stripping out the references to the Power Language servers, as well as the Google Analytics code shortly, because I don't care who accesses this. I just like word games.
