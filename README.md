# Pre-NYT-Wordle-Clone
A direct clone of the Wordle source code, before the NYT ruins it with ads. The entire wordlist is stored in the website's JavaScript, so the page will run correctly on it's own for hundreds of days. I'll be stripping out the Google Analytics code shortly, because I don't care who accesses this. I just like word games.
